;;; Commentary:

;; This extension for po-mode does four things:
;;
;; * On edit, po-mode inserts a "<" at the end of the msgstr. This mark is made
;;   read-only, so that you can neither delete it accidentally nor insert text
;;   after it.
;;
;; * After edit, msgstrs are automatically re-wrapped to a width specified by
;;   `po-wrap-width' (but no extraneous newlines are introduced).
;;
;; * The handling of the window of the subedit buffer (which is the buffer where
;;   you edit a msgstr) is improved.
;;
;;   The exact behavior is controlled by `po-po-to-edit-buffer':
;;   If it is nil, the subedit buffer will appear in a small window at the
;;   top of the window showing the po file.  Its height will adapt to the
;;   number of lines in the msgstr.
;;   If it is non-nil, the subedit buffer will be shown using `pop-to-buffer'
;;   like with plain po-mode, but the behavior on exiting the subedit
;;   window is more like what you would expect.
;;
;; * Finally, the fuzzy mark on an entry is removed after a successful edit.

;; Usage: just load this file after loading po-mode, e.g. with
;;
;;   (eval-after-load 'po-mode '(load "gb-po-mode"))

;;; Code:
