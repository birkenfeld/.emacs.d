Emacs configuration of Georg Brandl
===================================

This is my personal ``.emacs.d`` directory. Feel free to copy anything
you like and adapt it to your liking.

I'm just committing anything installed through elpa, so it might not
always be up-to-date.

**Purpose of subdirectories**

- ``setup``: code that gets run on initialization of emacs
- ``local-setup``: not in the repository; code that gets run on init
- ``lisp``: my own lisp libraries, or single-file libraries not on ELPA
- ``ext-lisp``: third-party large lisp libraries not on ELPA
- ``themes``: lisp files that contain color themes
- ``elpa``: third-party lisp libraries installed from ELPA
- ``saved``: will contain all files/dirs with saved stuff/caches created by emacs
